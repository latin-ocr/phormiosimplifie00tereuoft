PREFACE

Ome of the main objections to our present High School
Latin curriculum is the almost complete exclusion of the
colloquial language. Thus, while students, entering upon
the study of German, French, or Spanish, begin with the
language of daily life, and are led on by gradual stages
to the higher forms of literature, in Latin we reverse the
process and confine our school studies to Roman historical,
oratorical, and poetical works. Some of the very sewu
who continue their Latin studies at college, may reach a
point where they will read a play of Terence or Plautus,
but as for the rest, they leave school or college with the
rooted conviction or, at least, impression that Latin is a
purely artificia] language, used only for literary purposeS,
but never employed as the speech of daily life.

One reason for this neglect of conversational Latin
lies in the absence of suitable material for school use.
Cicero's Leuers, with few exceptions, are quite as diffi-
cult as his Oratione and display a good deal of erudition.
On the other hand, the plays of Plautus and Terence,
which are the great storehouse of colloquial Latin, be-
long to an early period, and therefore involve certain
archaisms and peculiarities of diction, syntax, and metm,
which are beyond the reach of the young student.

And yet it is a well-known fact that the style of Ter-
ence is not only simple but remarkably pure, even when

compared with the literature of a later period. Cicero
