praises the dramatist for this quality, and Caesar speaks
of him as puri- sermonis amator, “lover of Latin unde-
filed.'' The graceful ease of refined conversational style
and the thoroughly idiomatic flavor of Terence's language
have satisfied the best Latinists of every age.'

The present edition is an attempt to adapt a play of
Terence 60 66 10 611111111616, 66 far as possible, all ante-
Ciceronian peculiarities. The metrical form of the origi-
nal is abandoned and the order of words is slightly
changed, 60 66 to prevent 13116 intrusion of verse-rhythm.
Archaic forms 616 altered to conform 130 16161 usage, and
even when some of 1311666 616 retained in certain formulae

found in Cicero. A few forms are 16]·601611, because, though used by
Cicero, they are rare and unfamiliar to the young student; e.g. nosmet
(961).

2 Thus eaeonerare (843) is necessary in view of the contrast with one-
rare (842). Similar are the abusive terms emtor-tor and contortor (374).
’ 8 Thus corradere (40), the expressive word sor ‘ seraping together '
money, though not found in Cicero, was not distinctly vulgar, as it is
used metaphorically by Lucretius, and occurs later in the Diyest. The
nearest equivalent‚ converrere, is found only once in Cicero. Again,
the coarse word emunqere (682) 16 retained, because there is no strik-
