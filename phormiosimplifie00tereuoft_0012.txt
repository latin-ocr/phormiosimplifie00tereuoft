The adaptation of an older pieoe of literature to later
standards is easily paralleled in other languages. Thus
in German, a number of modernized versions of Grim-
melshausen⁷s Simplizissimus (1669) 113νο been published,
and in the Reclam library (Leipzig) the old romanoe Till
Eulenspieqel (1519) and the satirical novel Schelmuffisky
(1696) have appeared in modern form.> Numerous ren-
derings of still older works could be mentioned, such as
that of the Nibelanqenlied in prose by J. 8011011, and of
the 831110 work in abbreviated form for the young by
A. Baemeister (1874, 2d ed.); of Gudrun by Simrook‚
J unghanS‚ and others; of Wolfram von Eschenbaoh's
Parzival by Simrook, Hertz, and several others; and of
Gottfried von Strassburg's Tri-stan und Isolde by H. Kurz
and Simroek.

The present adaptation of the Phormio is a much
humbler effort than any of these just mentioned. It is
designed as a 8011001 book, and therefore the original has
been considerably ourtailed. However, nothing essential
to the understanding of the plot has been omitted. The
eliminations inolude everything that could be considered
questionable from the point of view of modern taste.

The edition may be used at almost any time after the
completion of a first-year Latin book. Many teaohers
