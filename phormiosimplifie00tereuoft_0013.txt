maynus and ἀίρηιιε, not mc‘zqnus‚ digmus. The pronoun ’

hic is distinguished from the adverb Ῑιῐο ; eius, liniue,
caius, maior, άίὃ are marked as in Allen and Greenough's

Terence, 1736 A.D.‚ are reproductions of soenes depioted
in old manuscripts of our author. They represent the
stage eustoms of early times.

shown an interest in this little work. If it is found that
the book meets a real need, it will be followed by other
plays similarly treated, or by a collection of soenes from

various eomedies.
