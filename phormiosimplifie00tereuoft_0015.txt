In the prosperous years that followed the Second Punic
War there lived at Rome a celebrated group of literary
men, known in history as the Scipionic circle. Here
were the younger Scipio AfricanuS, the most distinguished
citizen of his generation, Laelius, wh0, along with ScipiO,

encouragement and guidance that Terence wrote. The
story of his life, as it has come down to US, is quickly

the name Publius Terentius, the African. He soon won
distinction as a poet by writing six plays of the type
called fabulae palliatae, which are close imitations in
Latin of certain Greek comedies. The titles of his plays
are The Μαῖα os Andros, The Motlzer-iwLaw‚ The δεῖ]-
Tor-mentor, The Eunach, The ΡΙιοντπίο, and sse Brothers.
They were produced on the stage at Rome in this order

diction, the exquisite purity of language, are qualities
