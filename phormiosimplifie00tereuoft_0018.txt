xiv ἢ INTRODUCTION

plan 01 1116 old men to have Antipho and Phanium marry,
and here it had come about unsuggested and unaided.
Chremes acquaints Demipho with the wonderful news.
It is evident that the arrangement with Phormio must 116
annulled‚ and s0 they hastily seek him out, Demipho
demanding his money baek. But the parasite, knowing
well enough that Antipho will not be 10111 from his bride,
puts on the bold front of an injured party. The old men
threaten to 10106 the money from him by law, but Phor-
mio retorts by exposing in loud tones Chremes' double
1116. The guilty old man is thunderstruek. He tries 10
31οΡ 1116 gossip’s mouth, but it is 100 1616; 101 Nausis—
trata, hearing the hubbub, eomes forth and soon gathers
new light on her husband's frequent visits to Lemnos.
Having now the whip hand over Chremes and being her-
self not opposed to Phaedria's match, she makes it clear
that the lovers are to be made happy.
